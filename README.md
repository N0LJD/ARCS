ARCS – Amateur Radio Call Service

ARCS (Amateur Radio Call Service) is a self-hosted, Docker-based application that provides a local FCC ULS callsign database, a HamQTH-compatible XML API, and a lightweight web interface for convenience and testing.

ARCS is designed for read-only public query access, clear separation of responsibilities, and predictable, auditable operation.

This project is not affiliated with HamQTH, HamCall, Buckmaster International LLC, or the FCC. It is an independent, open-source educational and community project.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY THIS PROJECT EXISTS

ARCS exists as a practical learning and integration project.

It brings together Linux system administration, Docker container orchestration, MariaDB schema design and bulk data ingestion, API development using FastAPI, secure credential handling, and layered application architecture.

Amateur Radio provides the real-world data and motivation that ties these components together.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

ARCS is intentionally split into distinct services, each with a clearly defined role.

Web UI (nginx)
  |
  | /api
  v
XML API (FastAPI, read-only)
  |
  | SELECT queries only
  v
MariaDB (FCC ULS data)
  ^
  |
Importer (one-shot, write access)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONTAINERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

MariaDB (uls-mariadb)
- Persistent database container
- Stores FCC ULS data
- Initialized once and reused
- No externally exposed ports

Importer (uls-importer)
- One-shot job container
- Downloads FCC ULS data
- Applies schema
- Loads and merges tables
- Uses a write-capable database account
- Not exposed externally

XML API (xml-api)
- Public-facing service
- HamQTH-compatible XML responses
- Uses read-only database credentials
- Intended for callbook and logging applications

Web UI (web-ui)
- Convenience interface
- Proxies /api requests to xml-api
- Optional; the API can be used independently

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATABASE SECURITY MODEL

ARCS enforces least-privilege access by design.

Purpose            Database User   Privileges
Schema and import  uls             Write
Public XML API     xml_api         Read-only

Important points:
- The XML API never uses write-capable credentials
- Import credentials are never exposed publicly
- Database users are managed explicitly by admin scripts
- Credentials are provided via Docker secrets only

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECRETS HANDLING

Secrets are not stored in images or source code.

They are created locally in the secrets directory:

secrets/mariadb_root_password.txt
secrets/mariadb_user_password.txt
secrets/xml_api_password.txt

These files are generated by admin/first-run.sh, mounted into containers as Docker secrets, and read at runtime only.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STARTUP PHILOSOPHY

ARCS favors explicit, documented sequencing over hidden automation.

For a fresh install:
1. The database is started
2. The importer loads schema and data
3. Read-only database users are created
4. Public services are started

This avoids race conditions and makes failures obvious and debuggable.

A future XML API wait wrapper may allow fully automatic startup, but this is intentionally deferred and documented rather than implicit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUICKSTART

See QUICKSTART.md for a complete, step-by-step setup guide.

The Quickstart covers:
- First-run initialization
- Importing FCC data
- Verifying the API and Web UI
- Managing database users
- Restarting services

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

API COMPATIBILITY

The XML API is compatible with the HamQTH XML API specification.

Example query:

http://localhost:8080/xml.php?callsign=W1AW

Responses are returned as XML and suitable for logging applications, callbook lookups, and amateur radio utilities.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MANAGING DATABASE USERS (ADVANCED)

Database accounts are defined in admin/db-users.txt.

Format:

# account,password,priv
xml_api,public,r

Apply changes with:

./admin/apply-db-users.sh

Preview changes safely with:

./admin/apply-db-users.sh --dry-run

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROJECT STATUS

ARCS is stable, self-contained, and suitable for personal or community hosting. It is designed for transparency, education, and predictable operation.

Planned future enhancements may include optional reverse-proxy hardening, an optional startup wait wrapper, and expanded documentation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LICENSE AND DISCLAIMER

This project is provided as-is, without warranty.

ARCS is not affiliated with the FCC, HamQTH, HamCall, or Buckmaster. It does not redistribute proprietary callbook data and uses publicly available FCC ULS data only.

Use responsibly and in accordance with applicable laws and amateur radio regulations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FINAL NOTES

ARCS is intentionally conservative in automation, explicit in operation, and clear in security boundaries.

If you can read the scripts, you can understand exactly what the system is doing.

That is by design.
