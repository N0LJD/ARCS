# db-users.template.txt
# ---------------------
# Copy to db-users.txt and edit.
#
# Format: account,password,priv
#
# priv values:
#   r = read-only       (SELECT)
#   w = read/write      (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
#   a = admin on schema (ALL PRIVILEGES on DB)
#
# Lines beginning with # are comments.
# Blank lines are ignored.
#
# Example:
# xml_api,public,r
# admin_user,S0m3Str0ngPass!,a
#
# IMPORTANT:
# The schema/header line must be commented so scripts don't treat it as a real account:
# account,password,priv
